Lisa Marie at Visette was a dream to work with and made me the PERFECT custom wedding dress. Lisa guided me through the whole process and helped me realize what dress would work best for my body and made that dream an incredible reality.  I can't speak highly enough of Lisa Marie and her exquisite work!

Each time I visit this boutique I know my wife is going to go home happy. The styles, designs are of the most elegant standard. Seattle’s most noteworthy boutique for up scale fashion. The pieces form to my wife like no other. I write this review with high praise. When you find something this good, support it!

One of the best stores in town. You can find really cool Japanese and French brands. Plus, they have discounts usually, and not overpriced. I bought several jeans and shirts, they all have high quality and style. Internal decoration is also very cool.
